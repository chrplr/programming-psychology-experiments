# Measuring reaction time expyriment

Got to `xpy_simple_reaction_times`

1. run `simple-detection-visual-expyriment.py`

2. The resuts are in `data`. Use `analyse_rt.py` to plot them.

3. Check `simple-detection-visual-expyriment-with-stats.py`

Continue with sections "simple reaction times" and  "parity decision" of the document

# RandomDotKinematogram

1. In `experiments/kinematogram`, check `random_walk*.py`.

2. read and follow instructions in `experiments/kinematogram/README.md`

2. Starting from the script `experiments/kinematogram/kinematogram_v0.py`:

- program an experiment where the participant must decide if the coherent motion is up or down. There should be several trials for each degree of coherence among 10%, 20%, 30, 40% 50%. Use `exp.data.save` to save the data of each trial

- Plot the percentage of correct decisions up/down, and reaction times, as a function of coherence.
